Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:

HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc..

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.

You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.

At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc..

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.

You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.

At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

How does it feel to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like: Codeforces, CodeChef, TopCoder or HackerRank?
Originally Answered: How it feels to get first goodies from online coding contests held by popular sites like codeforces, codechef, topcoder or hackerank?
My first Goodie was a Planet HackerEarth T-Shirt :) . I won it in Vietnam National Programming Contest. It was a 4 hours contest with 5 problems. I managed to solve 3 problems completely and 1 partially, and ended up at 28th rank. I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.

Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!

I saw the contest page and there was an update: "We're also giving out top 30 winners HackerEarth t-shirts and swags.". Firstly I was not sure that I will get the T-shirt or not, as it was a national contest. After around 15-20 days I thought the contest was only for Vietnamese, but, then I received an email asking me to claim my T-shirt. That was one of the best mom… (more)

Which do you like more? Codechef or Codeforces?
Originally Answered: Is Codeforces better than CodeChef?
No doubt, Codeforces is far better than Codechef is you're an average or above-average coder.

Codeforces has a minimum of 6 contest each month where Codechef has only 3.
Codeforces organize only short contests which help to improve efficiency.
Codeforces has real competition, most of the top Competitive programmers are on Codeforces.
Codeforces rating is considered to be genuine than coz Codechef has a long challenge which leads to false ratings due to cheatings.
Codeforces has better UI and as well as a good set of problems.
As I said Codeforces is good if you're an average coder, if you're newbie … (more)

Which of these did you find more useful for competitive programming and learning, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, etc.?
The answer entirely depends on what you are preparing for and your level of experience.

If you want to prepare for Competitive Programming:

If you are a complete beginner:
Start with Hackerrank.
HackerEarth can follow this.
2. If you have some prior experience:

Start Practicing on Codechef.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
Try participating in both Long as well as Short challenges.
3. If you are intermediate programmer:

Start with Codeforces.
As you practice, participate in various competitions hosted by Codechef.
If you are preparing for interviews:

How can I get a good (under 100) rank on coding sites like HackerEarth, HackerRank or CodeChef?
Originally Answered: How can I get a good(under 100) rank on coding sites like hacker earth, hacker rank or code chef?
Hi,

By Seeing this question. I opened my account in HackerEarth and started some code tests and completed 32 simple tests of SQL. It takes 2 hrs 30 min to complete the tests means in between i too have taken break for some time even though it took long time to understand, analyze and develop the solution.

You said that you want to start your career in technical side that means firstly you have to know these things.

how you think for exmp, squaring of a number. What this question means to you? like how you think when i say this question to you? what in my mind is sqauring a number like in the inpu

How can I improve in competitive programming? I can only solve mostly A questions and some B questions on Codeforces.
As for the approach, I will give you some short tips:


At first get speed, confidence and be comfortable in solving CF Div.2 A problems. Then gradually start practicing B and C problems.
There is no point in taking part in contests without up solving them later if you want to grow. Upsolving means "solving problems after the contest".
You will improve a lot by seeing the code of other 4-8 top performers. If you solved a problem, then see how others have solved. It will teach you to write simple and fast codes.
Study basic data structures and algorithms. Many people recommend the CLRS book.

Originally Answered: Which is the best, code chef or code forces or hacker rank or hacker earth, for beginners to learn easily?
Hackerrank:
It has lots of domains for learners and one can practice in various domains such as Warmup, Artificial Intelligence, Ruby, Algorithms, etc.. There are contests conducted for Prizes, Hiring and College contests. For beginners it will be a nice place to start programming. After challenge over one can see others code in submissions where it will be visible only in some contests.

Additionally, one can conduct their own contest in Hackerrank for free.

Ranked in top 50 Indian competitive programmersUpdated 4y

Should I do HackerRank, SPOJ, TopCoder, CodeForces or CodeChef?
HackerRank - Primarily a hiring platform. If you are in your final or pre-final year, this would be the platform where most of your preliminary rounds would take place for hiring as an intern and a full time employee. Start working on the platform a couple of months before your expected applications.
SPOJ - If your basics are strong there are better chances of adapting when modified questions are asked. Classical questions on SPOJ are great once you are done with first programming course at your institute.
TopCoder - Old is Gold. Most of the great programmers have aced on this platform and it is highly recognised in the industry. Great platform for improving medium-hard to hard topics. Fairly experienced programmers will enjoy here.
CodeForces - My personal favourite. Best UI, amazing coding community and great problems. I have personally gained maximum from this platform. If you want to have an interactive engagement with competitions this is your place. It is the Quora of coding platforms.
CodeChef - No test cases are visible so you improve a lot as you have to think and debug where you go wrong. If you want a future in Direct-I or Zeta or Media.net, then make sure you have a lot of stars on your CodeChef profile.
HackerEarth - Codemonk series is a great place to start competitive programming. I would have started here if I was a beginner. Recent contests have also improved in quality.
GeeksForGeeks - This is great for cracking interviews. Nothing more, nothing less!
I loved CodeForces as a platform and as a community.

I never worked a lot on SPOJ or CodeChef because of their way too stringent time limit constraints. They timed out on the expected solutions in Java and hence were a big turn-off for me.

Regardless, I participated in all possible contests on available platforms.

Participate in all, practice on one or two!
