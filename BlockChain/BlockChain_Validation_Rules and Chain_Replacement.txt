1> Has to consist of Right Fields
2>Actual LastHash references
3> Hash needs to be valid

How to check three-
timeStamp:
Data:
LastHash:
Hash:

First we will take{timeStamp,Data,LastHash} and regernerate the Hash
Then we compare this new and real Hash with the this.Hash
if(Hash!=this.Hash){
    We know that the feild values{timeStamp,Data,LastHash} have been tampered with(in the attackers favour, to say a case)
}


Chain Replacement->
Lets take Example of one node. It will keep track of its transactions, build blocks, and add them to Block Chain
This is all good, but the power of BlockChain shines when we are having it used by many nodes. 
So, now lets consider the case of work during the day, rest during the night.
So, during the day, all nodes will buildup Blocks and tally transactions as they are supposed to and Add it to their instance of BlockCjhain. 
At the end of the day, all Nodes will have variety of Chains. 
Now, that they have finished the work, its time to again merge these blockChains into one assimilated BlockChain, which has been agreed by all others. 
This longer and valid Block Chain replaces the instance of BlockChain on each Node, and then the Process is over. 
The next day, Nodes will work on this BlockChain , with each node starting from the same terminal, and this process continues...
